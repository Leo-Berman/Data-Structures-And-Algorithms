My results where that the hash table used more memory but were faster to search. The array size of a hash table is fixed at 7000 and the binary tree ended up having 4266 nodes.
On average, the hash table will use less traversales as the binary tree has to traverse the tree and the vector while the hash table only has to traverse the vector.
